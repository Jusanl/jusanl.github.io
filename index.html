         <div class="block_1">
            <p>One of the most famous of these creatures,
            besides their Alf-like appearance,
            is their immense migration. Every November thousands of
            herds migrate south to avoid the harsh winter.</p>
          </div>
         <div class="block_2">
           <p>Dust storms can rage during the summer, and the saigaâ€™s elongated snout prevents dirt and sand from getting into their lungs. In the frigid winters, the extended nose allows air to warm up.</p>
          </div>
         <div class="block_3">
            <p>During migrations these antelope
            can travel up to 72 miles in a single day!
            Though move along at a steady pace, but are
            capable of running up to 80 mph to escape predators.</p>
          </div>
        <p>Saigas are quite interesting looking antelopes. Their bodies look relatively similar to most other antelope species, but their heads are quite the exception.<br>
           They have two enlarged nostrils that point downward and connect to an oversized nose. This nose looks somewhat similar to that of an elephant seal.<br>
           In males, the head is also topped by a pair of slightly translucent, ringed horns. Their fur ranges from red to yellow in color.</p>
      <p>These highly endangered creatures are in great danger of extinction. Researchers believe their populations have declines as much as 95% in the past 15 years.<br>
        These incredibly interesting and well-adapted antelopes deserve our protection.
