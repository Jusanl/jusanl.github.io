   <h1>Habitat of the Saiga Antelope</h1>
    <p>These antelopes live in semideserts, grasslands, open woodlands, and steppes.<br> They avoid travelling through heavily forested areas,<br> preferring to stay out in the open where they can spot predators and run unimpeded. <br> Saigas will also avoid areas that are extremely rocky or steep terrain for the same reason.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="block_2">
   <h1>Distribution of the Saiga Antelope</h1>
    <p>Historically, these animals were widespread across <br>central Asia, from the British Isles to the Bering Strait.<br> Unfortunately, their populations have become fragmented by area.<br> A few separate populations occur in Kalmykia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Russia.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="block_3">
   <h1>Diet of the Saiga Antelope</h1>
    <p>The saigaâ€™s diet consists mainly of plants. They will even eat plants that are poisonous to other animals. Because they do not eat other animals they are considered herbivores. They graze on low growing vegetation, and are known to eat over 100 different plant species. Some commonly eaten foods are saltworts, sage grass, lichens, cypress, and grass.</p>

   <h1>Saiga Antelope and Human Interaction</h1>
    <p>Humans have <br> decimated saiga populations.<br> In the past, <br>these antelopes <br>were hunted very heavily for meat,<br> and also for their horns.<br> The horns were used in <br>Traditional Chinese Medicine,<br> and even proposed as an <br>alternative to rhino horns.<br> Illegal hunting is still a major problem,<br> and populations have <br>suffered because of it.<br> Natural illnesses have exacerbated <br>this decline, and in some<br> instances as many as <br>one-third <br>of the population has perished.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="block_5">
   <h1>Physical barriers</h1>
    <p>Agricultural advancement and human settlements have been shrinking habitat areas of the saigas since the 20th century. Occupants limited saiga's passage to water resources and the winter and summer habitats. The ever-changing face of steppe requires saigas to search for new routes to their habitual lands. Currently, saiga populations' migratory routes pass five countries and different man-made constructions, such as railways, trenches, mining sites, and pipelines. These physical barriers limit movement of the antelopes. Cases of saiga herds being trapped within fenced areas and starving to death have been reported. Starting in 2011, Kazakhstan has built more than 150 km of wire fence at the border with Uzbekistan. This fence limits seasonal migration of saigas and other smaller animals. Although concerns have been stated, the fences are still being built.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="block_6">
   <h1>Climatic variability</h1>
    <p>Saigas are dependent on weather and affected by climate fluctuations to a great extent due to their migratory nature.<br> Harsh winters with strong winds or high snow coverage disable feeding on the grass under the thick snow. Population size usually dramatically decreases after severe cold months. Recent trends in climate change lead to increasing aridity of the steppe region, thus, deficiency of the grazing pastureland.<br>
      An estimate of 14% or more of available pastureland is considered degraded and useless.<br> Consequently, small steppe rivers dry faster, limiting water resources to large lakes and rivers, which are usually populated by human settlements.<br> Moreover, high temperatures in the steppe region lead to springtime floods, in which saiga calves can drown.</p>
